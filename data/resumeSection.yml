  ## My Background

  The notion of how computers can learn from the data and emulate human thinking is what I have consistently been enthusiastic about. To feed my cravings, 
  I decided to pursue studies in Computer Science with a major in Data Science.
 
 
  Most recently, I have worked as an Operational Team Analyst at  Bunnings Warehouse.
  Before that I gained the Junior Data Analyst experience at the Simplior Technologies. While studying, I  also worked as a __Research Intern__ for the Robotic Interaction for Assistance Training Dogs project at the Swinburne University of Technology.
