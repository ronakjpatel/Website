service: The main goal of this small snippet of the code is to show how we can perform data augmentation on images to create more images.
solution: Created the visualization of the augmented images.

One of the ways to increase the diversity of the training dataset is to create copies of the existing data and make small modifications to them. This is called “data augmentation.”.
 
Data augmentation technique helps to improve performance and predictions of the machine learning models by forming and adding new slightly altered data into the train dataset. If the training dataset caters for more diverse data and is large enough then the model will certainly perform better in the real time.
